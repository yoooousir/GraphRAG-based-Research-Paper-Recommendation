The portrait miniature developed from the illuminated manuscript tradition. These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in watercolours on vellum, stiffened by being glued to a playing card. Panel paintings in oils on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.\\nUnlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although Nicholas Hilliard was appointed her official limner, or miniaturist and goldsmith. George Gower, a fashionable court portraitist created Serjeant Painter in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from 1581 until his death in 1596.\\nElizabeth sat for a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, Cornelis Ketel, Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari, Isaac Oliver, and most likely to Gower and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors. Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen, and the fashionable long galleries of later Elizabethan country houses were filled with sets of portraits. The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved \"face patterns\", or approved drawings of the queen, to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.\\n\\n\\n===')),\n"," GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Hans Holbein The Younger', type='Person'), Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), Node(id='Whitehall Palace', type='Location'), Node(id='Jane Seymour', type='Person'), Node(id='Titian', type='Person'), Node(id='Philip Ii Of Spain', type='Person')], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Hans Holbein The Younger', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), type='COURT_ARTIST'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Hans Holbein The Younger', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Whitehall Palace', type='Location'), type='CREATED_MURAL_AT'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Hans Holbein The Younger', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Jane Seymour', type='Person'), type='PAINTED'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Titian', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Philip Ii Of Spain', type='Person'), type='PAINTED')], source=Document(metadata={'title': 'Portraiture of Elizabeth I', 'summary': 'The portraiture of Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603) spans the evolution of English royal portraits in the early modern period (1400/1500-1800), from the earliest representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.\\nEven the earliest portraits of Elizabeth I contain symbolic objects such as roses and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day.

Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait, although none of his originals now survive. His great dynastic mural at Whitehall Palace, destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.\\nBoth Holbein and his great Italian contemporary Titian had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons. By his second visit, Holbein had already begun to move away from a strictly realist depiction; in his Jane Seymour, \"the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline\". This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where \"Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly\".\\n\\nTitian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of Philip II of Spain, until the 1570s, but

Her parents were Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia and Catherine. Catherine was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński, a subject of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Saint Petersburg at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac\\'s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (\"princess\") on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter\\'s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.\\nAs a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education.

Her reign is often referred to as the Elizabethan Era, a period marked by significant cultural, political, and economic transformation.\n","\n","### Key Aspects of Elizabeth I's Reign\n","\n","1. **Religious Settlement**:\n","   - Elizabeth established the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, which created a moderate form of Protestantism that sought to unify her kingdom and reduce religious conflict. This settlement included the Act of Supremacy (1559), which re-established the English monarch as the head of the Church of England, and the Act of Uniformity (1559), which set the order of prayer to be used in the English Book of Common Prayer.\n","\n","2. **Cultural Flourishing**:\n","   - Her reign saw a great flowering of English culture, particularly in literature and the arts. This period, known as the English Renaissance, produced iconic figures such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Edmund Spenser.\n","\n","3. **Military and Naval Strength**:\n","   - The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 is one of the most celebrated events of Elizabeth's reign. It marked the decline of Spain's dominance and the rise of England as a major naval power.\n","\n","4. **Exploration and Trade**:\n","   - Elizabeth's reign was also notable for the expansion of English exploration and trade. Explorers like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh expanded English influence and established early colonies in the New World.\n","\n","5. **Political Stability and Governance**:\n","   - Despite challenges, Elizabeth managed to maintain relative internal stability. Her government included skilled advisors like Sir William Cecil (Lord Burghley) and Sir Francis Walsingham, who helped her navigate the complexities of ruling a diverse and often fractious kingdom.\n","\n","6. **Economic Changes**:\n","   - The Elizabethan economy saw the beginning of the transition from feudalism to early capitalism. The era witnessed the growth of the merchant class and the beginning of England's transformation into a major economic power.\n","\n","7. **Marriage and Succession**:\n","   - Elizabeth never married, earning her the nickname \"The Virgin Queen.\" Her refusal to marry and produce an heir led to uncertainty about the succession, which was eventually resolved when James VI of Scotland, the son of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, ascended to the English throne as James I after Elizabeth's death.\n","\n","Elizabeth I's reign is often remembered for its successes in consolidating England's power and fostering a cultural renaissance, setting the stage for the nation's future as a global power.\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"0a26eea96d934938b634256ca8806a5f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["GraphWidget(layout=Layout(height='500px',
